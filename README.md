# Procedural Undergrowth

## Abstract
This demo creates procedural but deterministic renderings of the flora underneath a forestâ€™s canopy for use in video games.
My implementation proposes one method of rendering the ground which uses multiple height maps and shader discards and combines this with traditional instanced rendering of foliage.
